      "Lost my phone under a pile of papers. Â Luckily I didn&rsquo;t have to wait long till one of the alerts made it make a noise.",
      "Ah, I love the smell of pull requests in the morning. Smells like&hellip; hotfixes.",
      "He&rsquo;s missed a trick not calling this &ldquo;batshit&rdquo;",
      "It was that the database failed and it took it 30 secs to failover, by which time puma had gone into a tailspin and couldn&rsquo;t recover. Cascade-failure-tastic.",
      "I have devs asking if the training session will be recorded so they can watch later.Â Presumably they have important panicking and running around in circles scheduled for this afternoon.",
      "We&rsquo;re now trying PDD. Which is Production Driven Development swiftly followed by Panic Driven Development.",

      "The dev team themselves are excellent - they take advice, discuss what&rsquo;s best for all, act like DevOps themselves.Â They do packaging, they like telemetry a lot.Â It&rsquo;s the team leaders &amp; architects. Â They run after the shiny like a cat on a laser.",

      "We&rsquo;d need two out of five to fail on both clusters before we&rsquo;d lose anything customer facing.Â Or the DC to burn down.",
      "Cassandra is a RAVES.Â Redundant Array of Very Expensive Servers",
      "Yeah. Â It&rsquo;s all broken.Â Our wallboard is a really nice checked pattern of red and green. Sort of like a panic inducing tartan.",
      "I&rsquo;m not sure whether the problem here is the prod alerts firing, or the decision to call something &lsquo;prod&rsquo; when it isn&rsquo;t prod quality yet.",
      "This bug shouldn&rsquo;t even exist. IÂ mean, why?Â I may make a pull request that fixes it by deleting the entire repo.",
      "Eng1: Where are we at with the clientâ€™s backups?\n\nEng2: I know that there is a backup running. I know it because BareOS attempting to start new jobs backing up their host has cancelled them because there was already a running job for that host. I also know that if I touch the clientâ€™s backup directory, I risk causing that job to abort.\n\nEng1: So, we know that the clientâ€™s backups are in a quantum state, and direct observation risks collapse.",
      "I have an outstanding timesheet. I&rsquo;m saying nothing.",
      "Genuine question from my devs: Can we make our monitoring send an alert to Pagerduty which will tell GoCD to relaunch the failed service? My reply was basicallyÂ &quot;Have you considered writing stuff that doesn&rsquo;t fall down once a day on average?",

      "That&rsquo;s a common reason to put Terraform state in git. In theory you can merge the state of your feature branch into the state of your production branch once you&rsquo;ve mangled them independently. In practice I reckon that&rsquo;s ripe for disaster without, at the very least, something to assert the JSON is at least semantically correct as a git hook.\n\nOr you can invoke the magic letters TCO and just pay the Hashicorp people who have solved the problem to give you their solution and get on with your life. But where&rsquo;s the fun in that?",
      "I&rsquo;m reading the new features list for Ubuntu 16.04 and &ldquo;New Default Wallpaper&rdquo; impressed me most, so far",
      "Looking into my queue issues more closely reveals the following fuckery: Dev estimates message size at 2k. Â Ops checks disk, which is 20G, and puts in place a limit of 1 million messages. Â Dev decides instead to use a new message, which is around 25k. Â Dev also decides to run the enqueuing job first, see what happens, and then run the dequeueing job afterwards. Â \n\nOddly enough, one million 25k messages is 25G, so the disk fills and it all falls over. Â Dev apparently does not understand the &lsquo;queues&rsquo; are not 'magic infinite storage devices&rsquo;, but just disk space with access mediated by a computer program .",

      "It&rsquo;s not a bug that stops things working. It&rsquo;s a feature flag.",
      "I&rsquo;m already in a bad mood because the train air con was on all the way to London.Â When I told the train company&rsquo;s twitter morons, they asked &ldquo;was it cold?&quot;Â Now they&rsquo;re telling me they can&rsquo;t fix it because I didn&rsquo;t note down the carriage number, only the train.Â I&rsquo;ve suggested they get someone to walk the length of the train till they find themselves going &quot;Oh, it&rsquo;s a bit parky in &lsquo;ere&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;ll be the broken carriage.",
      "Mmmmm - graphs with daily granularity. I can almost taste the lack of visibility of immediate issues.",
      "500 posts! Who&rsquo;d a thunk it?",
      "One of my engineers today&hellip; Â  (it&rsquo;s been a particularly shitty day for Ops)\n&ldquo;My father always told me you need to study son&hellip; or you gonna work with computers&rdquo;",

      "&ldquo;The client are a widely known household name and have a requirement for a DevOps Engineer (Ops) and a DevOps Engineer (Dev).&rdquo; &lt;&ndash; is that how it works then, this DevOps thing? Kind of like a three-legged race? A job share?Â One person comes in in the mornings and does the Devs, then is replaced by the other, who does the Ops?",
      "It&rsquo;ll be great. An opportunity to spring clean all the things, clear up old webhooks, build jobs and code workflows. Deprecate old repos, refactor and improve.Â And of course it won&rsquo;t turn into a massive whinge-fest consisting of two broken processes and people screaming &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my code gone!?!&rdquo;",
